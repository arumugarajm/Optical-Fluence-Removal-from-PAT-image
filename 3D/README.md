This directory has single file.
opticalfluence3D.m is a main file to generate the 3D fluence corrupted image. 
This file need sub-program files from iso2mesh, K-Wave toolbox, and NIRFAST toolbox. 
Note: We can use inbuilt function files from K-Wave toolbox. 
If you have GPU access then change input arguments in kspaceFirstOrder3D to gpu-Array it will accelerate the computation speed.
